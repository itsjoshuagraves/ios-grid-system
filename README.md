Grid system for designing iOS apps. Currently supports Fireworks.

About the iOS Grid System
===============

It’s optimized for all Apple’s devices as of September 2012 (yes, this works with iPhone 5!) in both portrait and landscape modes. It will be updated as new devices and resolutions arrive. For clarity:

- Non-Retina iPhones
- Retina iPhones
- iPhone 5
- Non-Retina iPad
- Retina iPad

This command doesn’t interfere with your existing artwork. It creates new shapes as symbols on a new layer. iOS Grid System also adds guides for all the columns and gutters, if that's your thing. It will resize your existing canvas, so it’s best to use this earlier on than later. 

You can use any of these commands multiple times in one document. Just create a new page and select the command you wish to run. That’s it!

How to install and use it
===============

1. Get the files from GitHub or right here at Smashing Magazine.
    a. If you’re downloading from Smashing Magazine, unzip the file.
    b. If you’re pulling the files from GitHub, you can download a zipped file or clone the repository directly onto your machine. Here’s the command you’ll use in the command line: <pre>git@github.com:joshuamauldin/ios-grid-system.git</pre>
2. Move your files into the following directory: 
    a. For Mac users: Applications » Fireworks CS6* » Configuration » Commands
    b. For Windows users: (INSERT PATH)
3. Open Fireworks and create a new document
    a. As previously mentioned, the size doesn’t matter. The command will resize your page accordingly.

I'm curious to see how and where you use it. Send me a link to your app a mobile site. I'd love to see it. Enjoy!
